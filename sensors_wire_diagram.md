A list of sensors and their wire diagram
## [HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor](https://components101.com/sensors/ultrasonic-sensor-working-pinout-datasheet)
function:  measure discance
wire diagram: 
| Pin Number | Pin Name | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
|1 |  Vcc | The Vcc pin powers the sensor, typically with +5V | 
|2 | Trigger | Trigger pin is an Input pin. This pin has to be kept high for 10us to initialize measurement by sending US wave. | 
|3  | Echo  |Echo pin is an Output pin. This pin goes high for a period of time which will be equal to the time taken for the US wave to return back to the sensor.|
|4  | Ground  | This pin is connected to the Ground of the system.|
